 * pub_channel_t — lets one producer thread hand its "latest snapshot" to many
 * consumer threads. The producer publishes a new value and wakes everyone
 * waiting; each consumer sleeps until something newer than what it last saw
 * arrives. The actual data lives in the caller's own storage (copied while the
 * lock is held), so this one primitive works for a payload of any type.
 *
 * Both current users (the MAC sensing-range publish and the KPM IQ publish)
 * run their consumer in the blocking on-data mode by default: the worker
 * sleeps in pub_channel_wait and is woken exactly on publish. The timedwait
 * path serves the optional periodic (throttled) mode.
