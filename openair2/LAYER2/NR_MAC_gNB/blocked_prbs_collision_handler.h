/*!
 * \brief Detection of collisions between blocked PRBs (radar avoidance,
 *        spectrum sharing) and UE-specific, RRC-configured periodic signals
 *        (PUCCH/SRS/CSI-RS), read from the periodic allocation registry.
 *
 * The registry is queried in BOTH directions, each tied to a distinct event:
 *
 *   - Event A: a (new) PRB-blocking policy is applied. We scan the existing
 *     allocations and report those the block now lands on.
 *     Entry: blocked_prbs_check_on_policy_update().
 *     Handlers: on_<signal>_hit_by_block().
 *
 *   - Event B: a UE's UE-specific signals are (re)configured (attach /
 *     reconfiguration / BWP switch). We check that UE's allocations against the
 *     currently-active block and report those placed on a blocked PRB.
 *     Entry: blocked_prbs_check_on_ue_config().
 *     Handlers: on_<signal>_placed_on_block().
 *
 * Each (signal, event) has its own handler (currently logging only) so the two
 * cases can later trigger different reactions.
 *
 * Cell-wide signals (SSB, CORESET0, PRACH) are out of scope here.
