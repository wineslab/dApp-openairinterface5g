This document contains documentation for the 5G RRC layer, destined towards
developers. It explains the basic working of the RRC, and various UE procedure
schemes (connection, reestablishment, handover) including their interworking
with other layers.

User documentation, such as general configuration options, are described in [a
separate page](./rrc-usage.md).

[[_TOC_]]

## General

5G RRC is basically an ITTI message queue with associated handlers. It
sequentially reads received ITTI messages and handles them through the function
`rrc_gnb_task()` (constituing the thread entry point function). In this
function, one can see three main groups of messages in a big switch statement:

- NGAP (messages starting with `NGAP_`)
- F1AP (messages starting with `F1AP_`)
- E1AP (messages starting with `E1AP_`)

For each message, a corresponding handler is called. The messages are roughly
named according to the 3GPP specification messages, so it should already be
possible to find the message in the switch based on a message name in the spec.

Note that RRC is inherently single-threaded, and processes messages in a FIFO
order.

## Sequence Diagrams of UE procedures

The following section presents a number of common UE procedures for connection
establishment&control, bearer establishment, etc. The intention is to help
developers find specific functions within RRC in the context of these
procedures. For more information on message handlers at F1 and E1 layers,
please refer to the respective [F1 documentation](../F1AP/F1-design.md) and [E1
documentation](../E1AP/E1-design.md).

For more information on these procedures, please also refer to 3GPP TS 38.401
(NG-RAN Architecture Description) and O-RAN.WG5.C.1-v11 (NR C-plane profile).

A lot of the following diagrams would show an exchange between CU-CP, DU, and
UE, in which the CU-CP forwards an "RRC Message" to the UE via an F1AP DL RRC
Message Transfer through the DU, and correspondingly receives the "RRC Message
Answer", as follows:

```mermaid

  du->>ue: RRC Message
  ue->>du: RRC Message Answer
  du->>cucp: F1AP UL RRC Msg Transfer (RRC Message Answer)
```

To better utilize horizontal space, these exchanges have been collapsed as
follows, but should be read as the above exchange:

```

### Initial connection setup/Registration

This sequence diagram shows the principal steps for an initial UE connection.
This can either happen through a _Registration Request_ (e.g., UE connects
"from flight mode"), or a _Service Request_ (i.e., UE connects after leaving
coverage). Both requests are handled similarly by the gNB, and basically
distinguish themselves, from the point of view of the gNB, by having PDU
sessions in the NGAP Initial Context Setup Request present (Service Request) or
not (Registration Request, with following PDU Session Resource Setup Request
procedure).

Note that if no PDU session is present in the NGAP Initial UE Context Setup
Req, no F1AP UE Context Setup will be observed during this initial phase.

If there is no PDU session set up during NGAP Initial Context Setup Req, the UE
typically requests a PDU session(s) through a NAS procedure, which is basically
the same code paths as the above optional PDU Session setup during an NGAP
Initial Context Setup procedure:

### Reestablishment

The following sequence diagram shows the principal steps during a
reestablishment request. When handling the RRC Reestablishment Request at the
CU-CP, it notably checks if this UE is already known, if the UE is still at the
same DU as it used to be previously (might change because of, or despite
handover), and other validation checks. If all checks pass, the CU-CP continues
with the reestablishment procedure; if any check fails, the CU-CP tries to
release the old UE at the AMF, and continues with the "normal" connection setup
(registration/service request) described above.

The re-establishment flow implements transparent forwarding of CellGroupConfig
per TS 38.473: the CU requests CellGroupConfig from the DU via UE Context
Modification Request with `gNB_DU_Configuration_Query=true`, and the DU responds
with an encoded CellGroupConfig that the CU forwards to the UE without
decode/re-encode cycles.

      Note over cucp: rrc_gNB_generate_RRCSetup()

  end
```

Note on re-establishment on different DU: The "UE known and on a different DU"
case is shown in the sequence diagram above. When a UE re-establishes on a
different DU than the original one (detected by comparing `du_assoc_id` at
RRCReestablishmentRequest), the CU updates `du_assoc_id` and sets
`f1_ue_context_active=false`. At RRCReestablishmentComplete, if
`f1_ue_context_active` is false, the CU triggers UE Context Setup on the new
DU per TS 38.401 §8.7.

### QoS Flows Handling

This section describes the end-to-end handling of QoS flows in the OAI 5G SA implementation. QoS flows are
the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in 5G systems. According to 3GPP specs, each PDU session can
contain multiple QoS flows (maximum 64). Each QoS flow is mapped to exactly one Data Radio Bearer (DRB)
within the gNB, but multiple QoS flows can be mapped to the same DRB. The mapping is determined by the
CU-CP and configured in the CU-UP via E1AP, and in the UE via RRC signaling. Each PDU session is mapped
to a SDAP entity and can contain multiple DRBs, each of which may carry multiple QoS flows.

Key Standards:
- 3GPP TS 23.501: 5G System Architecture (6.2.5, Quality of service)
- 3GPP TS 37.324: SDAP Protocol (QoS flow to DRB mapping, 5.3)
- 3GPP TS 38.463: E1AP (Bearer Context Management with QoS flows)
- 3GPP TS 29.281: GTP-U (QFI marking)
- 3GPP TS 38.331: RRC (Radio Bearer Configuration)

Trigger: PDU Session Establishment or Modification from 5G Core (AMF/SMF)

The PDU session setup flow in OAI begins when the gNB receives an NGAP PDU Session Resource Setup Request
from the AMF, containing session parameters and QoS flow information. These flows are stored in the UE
context and passed to the RRC layer, which maps each QoS flow to a DRB and prepares the E1AP Bearer
Context Setup Request for the CU-UP. The CU-UP then creates the corresponding PDCP and SDAP bearers,
establishes F1-U and N3 GTP-U tunnels, and returns a Bearer Context Setup Response. The GTP-U layer stores
QFI-to-DRB mappings for tunnel management, while the SDAP layer maintains QFI-to-DRB tables for both
uplink and downlink packet routing.

During data transfer, uplink packets are demultiplexed using the QFI from the GTP-U header, and downlink
packets are marked with their QFI before being sent to the UPF, ensuring consistent QoS-based traffic
handling end-to-end.

#### CU-CP QoS-flow to DRB mapping

The QoS-flow-to-DRB algorithm runs in the CU-CP (RRC) when flows are added or updated (for example
`nr_rrc_add_bearers`, `nr_rrc_assign_drb_to_qos_flow`, and `nr_rrc_find_suitable_drb_for_qos` in
`openair2/RRC/NR/rrc_gNB_radio_bearers.c`). E1AP does not implement this policy: Bearer Context
Setup/Modification simply carries the resulting PDU sessions, DRB lists, and QoS flows per DRB that RRC
already chose.

The mapping is OAI-specific (3GPP defines that the gNB may map multiple QoS flows to one DRB but does
not mandate these numeric caps).

DRB assignment uses a QoS-aware multiplexing strategy from standardized 5QI where available:

- Dedicated DRBs (one QoS flow per DRB in practice for these classes):
  - Delay-critical GBR (5QI 82–90): each such flow triggers a new DRB, existing DRBs that already carry
    DC-GBR are not reused for other flows.
  - Other flows treated as isolated: 5QI 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 70, 80, and 71-73.

- Multiplexed DRBs (when the new flow is not in the dedicated set, and reuse is allowed on a PDU session):
  - Non-delay-critical GBR flows: up to 2 QoS flows per DRB.
  - Non-GBR flows: up to 5 QoS flows per DRB.
  - Aggregate cap: at most 5 QoS flows per DRB in total (mixed GBR/non-GBR counts).

Per-DRB counting uses resource-type buckets (DC-GBR, GBR, non-GBR) derived from 3GPP TS 23.501
table 5.7.4-1 (standardized 5QI).

Dynamic 5QI without a numeric 5QI: OAI uses a conservative heuristic (packet delay budget, packet
error rate, and QoS priority thresholds) to decide whether the flow must use a new dedicated DRB or
may share an existing DRB. That path is independent of the static 5QI lists above.

### Inter-DU Handover (F1)

The basic handover (HO) structure is as follows. In order to support various
handover "message passing implementation" (F1AP, NGAP, XnAP), RRC employs
callbacks to signal HO Accept (`ho_req_ack()`), HO Success (`ho_success()`),
and HO Cancel (`ho_cancel()`). These can be used to trigger the corresponding
functionality based on mentioned "message passing implementation".

The following sequence diagram shows the basic functional execution of a
successful handover in the case of an F1 handover. Note the callbacks as
mentioned above:

### Inter-gNB Handover (N2)

This is an inter-NG-RAN procedure. The N2 handover specification is defined in the following documents:

* 3GPP TS 23.502, 4.9.1.3 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover:
  - Outlines detailed handover signaling flows for N2-based handovers.
  - Covers both intra-system (between 5G gNBs) and inter-system (between 5G and LTE eNBs) handovers.
* 3GPP TS 38.300, section 9 Mobility and State Transitions:
  - describes mobility procedures at the NG-RAN level, depending on the RRC state.
* 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP), section 8.4 UE Mobility Management Procedures:
  - Specifies the signaling procedures over the N2 interface.
  - Includes messages like Handover Request, Handover Command, and Handover Preparation.
* 3GPP TS 38.331 (RRC): details the UE-level RRC procedures involved during handovers

## Structures

### DUs and Cells

OAI 5G RRC is enabling support for multiple DUs, with each DU potentially
serving multiple cells (though currently each DU is limited to one cell in practice).
The architecture separates DU management from cell management to enable future
multi-cell per DU capability.

#### DU Management

DU-related data is stored in `nr_rrc_du_container_t`, and kept in a red-black
tree indexed by the unique SCTP association ID (`assoc_id`). Each DU container stores:
- DU identity and name
- SCTP association ID for F1 interface communication
- RRC version information
- Sequential array of cell pointers (`cells`) - stores pointers to cells belonging to this DU (seq_arr_t)

Key Functions:
- `get_du_by_assoc_id()` - Lookup DU by SCTP association ID (O(log d) tree lookup)
- `get_du_for_ue()` - Get DU associated with a specific UE
- `find_target_du()` - Find a target DU for handover operations

#### Cell Management

Cell-related data is stored in `nr_rrc_cell_container_t`. Cells are stored in two data structures:

1. Global cell tree (`rrc->cells`): Red-black tree indexed by `cell_id`, containing all cells from all DUs. Used for efficient O(log N_CELL) lookups across all DUs. PCI reuse across the network is allowed and this is reflected in the tree.
2. DU cell array (`du->cells`): Sequential array (seq_arr_t) of cell pointers, storing only cells belonging to that specific DU. Used for DU-specific operations. PCI must be unique within a DU.

Each cell container stores:
- Cell identity (NR Cell ID) and PCI (Physical Cell ID)
- Link to serving DU via the unique `assoc_id`
- Cell-specific information (PLMN, TAC, frequency, mode TDD/FDD)
- MIB, SIB1, and MeasurementTimingConfiguration messages

Key Functions:
- `get_cell_by_cell_id()` - Lookup cell by NR Cell ID using global cell tree
- `rrc_get_cell_for_du()` - Lookup cell by cell_id within a specific DU's cell array
- `rrc_get_cell_by_pci_for_du()` - Lookup cell by PCI within DU's cells array
- `rrc_add_cell_to_du()` - Add cell to DU's sequential array
- `rrc_free_cell_container()` - Free cell container and associated ASN.1 structures

Architecture Notes:
- The `assoc_id` field (in cell and DUs containers) links cells to their serving DUs
- When a DU connects via F1 Setup, cells are added to both the global tree and the DU's array
- When a DU disconnects, cells are removed from both structures
- Global tree enables efficient cross-DU cell lookups (O(log N_CELL))
- DU array enables efficient per-DU cell iteration (O(k) where k=cells per DU)
- Each DU maintains a sequential array of cell pointers

##### DU and Cell Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the lifecycle of DUs and their associated cells, including the main F1AP messages and internal operations:

    end
  end
  Note over CU,CellTree: DU and all cells removed
```

Key Functions:
- `rrc_gNB_process_f1_setup_req()` - Handles F1 Setup Request, creates DU and cell containers.
  Validates PLMN match, DU ID uniqueness, and cell_id/PCI uniqueness before creating containers.
- `rrc_gNB_process_f1_du_configuration_update()` - Handles cell configuration updates.
  Currently supports cell modification (MIB/SIB1 updates) and validates cell additions, but cell addition
  and deletion are not yet fully implemented.
- `rrc_CU_process_f1_lost_connection()` - Handles DU disconnection. Calls `rrc_cleanup_du()` to
  remove all cells and the DU from their trees and free resources, then
  `invalidate_du_connections()` to clean up UE associations (e.g. trigger NGAP UE Context Release Request for UEs on that DU).

#### UE Cell Association Management

The RRC maintains a per-UE association with serving cells, tracking which cells
a UE is currently using. This replaces the previous single-cell assumption and
enables proper multi-cell support where each UE can have multiple serving cells
(one PCell and up to 31 SCells). The servCellIndex (TS 38.331) is tracked per-UE
in the `ue_serving_cell_t` structure in the UE context (the same cell can have
different servCellIndex values for different UEs).

Data Structures:
- `ue_serving_cell_t`: Stores serving cell information (nci, servCellIndex, assoc_id)
- `gNB_RRC_UE_t.serving_cells`: Dynamic array (seq_arr_t) of serving cell entries. PCell is always at index 0.

Key Functions:
- `rrc_add_ue_serving_cell()` - Adds a new serving cell to UE's serving_cells array.
- `rrc_get_ue_serving_cell_by_id()` - Retrieves serving cell entry by servCellIndex.
- `ue_get_pcell_entry()` - Returns the PCell serving cell entry (first element in serving_cells).
- `rrc_remove_ue_scells_from_du()` - Removes all serving cells belonging to a specific DU via assoc_id (e.g. during handover or DU disconnection).

##### Handover and Cell Association Updates

During handover, the UE's serving cell list is updated so the PCell reflects the target cell and source-DU cells are removed.

###### F1 handover (inter-DU, same CU-CP)

Cell association is updated when the **source** DU sends F1AP UE Context Modification Response (after it has sent the RRC Reconfiguration to the UE). The CU-CP is a single RRC instance; both source DU and target DU are under the same CU.

```mermaid

    Note over CU: Handover complete: PCell = target cell, source DU cells removed
  end
```

###### N2 handover (inter-gNB: source CU vs target CU)

Cell association is updated only on the target CU-CP, when the target DU sends F1AP UE Context Setup Response. The UE context was created for handover, so there is no existing serving cell to remove. The flow is triggered inside the handover request acknowledge callback.

- Target CU-CP: Receives HANDOVER REQUEST, sets up bearer and F1 UE context on target DU; when the target DU sends F1AP UE Context Setup Response, the target CU runs the cell-association update and then sends HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.

```

### Neighbour cells

#### SIB3/SIB4 and measurement-gap implementation

The following section documents the implementation-level control flow
for SIB3/SIB4 and measurement-gap handling in current OAI, using the configured
neighbor cell list as a shared input model.

Briefly, the three procedures are:
- SIB3: CU derives and provides intra-frequency neighbour SI, which DU broadcasts
  and UE uses for autonomous idle/inactive intra-frequency reselection.
- SIB4: CU derives and provides inter-frequency carrier/neighbour SI, which DU
  broadcasts and UE uses for autonomous idle/inactive inter-frequency reselection.
- MeasGap: CU/DU coordinate dedicated `MeasGapConfig` in UE `MeasConfig`, DU
  scheduler interrupts transmission (`nr_measgap_scheduling()`) for the UE to
  apply the MeasGap configuration in connected mode for gap-based measurements that
  are sent as `MeasurementReport` and processed at CU-CP (`rrc_gNB_process_MeasurementReport()`).
  Event-driven reports (for example A3) are used by CU-side mobility logic and can
  trigger handover procedures.

```

## UE Context

UE context information is stored in `gNB_RRC_UE_t`, which includes:
- Serving cells tracking: Dynamic array of serving cells (PCell + SCells)
- Security context: Keys, algorithms, and security state
- Radio bearers: SRB and DRB configurations
- PDU sessions: Active PDU session information
- Handover context: Temporary data during handover procedures

### CU-UPs

CU-UP information is stored in `nr_rrc_cuup_container_t`, and kept in a tree
indexed by the SCTP association ID.

### Transactions

The RRC keeps track of ongoing transaction (RRC procedures) through a per-UE
array `xids`, which is indexed with a transaction ID `xid` in `[0,3]` to keep
track of ongoing transactions. Upon RRC Reconfiguration Complete, these IDs are
deleted.

Note that while 38.331 requires only one RRC transaction to happen at a time,
the 5G RRC does not actually ensure this; it only tries to prevent it by
chaining of transactions and some checks. For instance, the Security Mode
procedure is followed by a UE capability procedure, and some procedures are not
executed if others are ongoing (ex.: handover if there is reconfiguration).
However, it might be possible to trigger a procedure while another is ongoing.

As of now, no queueing mechanims exists to ensure only one operation is
ongoing, which would likely also simplify the code.

### Handover

Handover-related data is stored in a per-UE structure of type
`nr_handover_context_t`. It is a pointer and only set during handover
operation. This data structure has in turn two pointers, one to the source CU
(`nr_ho_source_cu_t`), and one to the target CU (`nr_ho_target_cu_t`). In F1,
both are present. In N2 and Xn, only one pointer is supposed to be set at the
corresponding CU.

- `nr_ho_source_cu_t` contains notably a function pointer `ho_cancel` for
handover cancel.  
- `nr_ho_target_cu_t` contains function pointers `ho_req_ack`
for handover request acknowledge, `ho_success` for handover success,
`ho_failure` for handover failure (N2 only).
be seen in the sequence diagram above, either the "target CU" or "source CU"
needs to do an operation, and a "switch" from target to source CU is done using
these function pointers. 
- For instance, in F1, the handover request acknowledge
function pointers merely calls another (RRC) function which triggers a
reconfiguration. 
- In the case of N2, the handover request acknowledge function
pointer should trigger the NGAP Handover Request Acknowledge, and the handover
success function pointer should trigger the NGAP Handover Success message.
