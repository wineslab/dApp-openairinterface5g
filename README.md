# Duranta - OpenAirInterface

Duranta OpenAirInterface RAN delivers and maintains an open-source cellular
wireless software stack for 4G, 5G and future networking technologies. It
supports simulation, prototyping, and end-to-end deployments on
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Built for research and
experimentation, it provides standard-compliant interfaces and is released
under the Collaborative Standards Software License (CSSL).

## How to get support from the Community

You can ask your question on the [mailing lists](https://github.com/duranta-project/openairinterface5g/wiki/MailingList).

Your email should contain below information:

- A clear subject in your email.
- For all the queries there should be [Query\] in the subject of the email and for problems there should be [Problem\].
- In case of a problem, add a small description.
- Do not share any photos unless you want to share a diagram.
- OAI gNB/DU/CU/CU-CP/CU-UP configuration file in `.conf` format only.
- Logs of OAI gNB/DU/CU/CU-CP/CU-UP in `.log` or `.txt` format only.
- In case your question is related to performance, include a small description of the machine (Operating System, Kernel version, CPU, RAM and networking card) and diagram of your testing environment.
- Known/open issues are present on [Github](https://github.com/duranta-project/openairinterface5g/issues), so keep checking.

Always remember a structured email will help us understand your issues quickly.
